    To Do:
    Check camera
    Weird thing beside current location

    Do:
    Ask geotag ("tag"?)
    DOCUMENT how program works, all 4 use cases.

    Program Description:
    This program has been tested with the simulator GPS service set to "City Bicycle Ride". When "start" is pressed, the app records and displays, via polylines, the route that has been taken by the biker. When stop is pressed, the route stops recording and continues to display the user's travelled path. The GPS tracker also continues to run so new movements by the user will be reflected on the map, just not recorded.
    Along the path if the user wants to take a picture, the user can press the "Camera" button, and the camera will pop up. If a photo is taken, a marker will be displayed on the mapView math on the coordinate that the photo was taken on. This was implemented since geotagging of photos is enabled by default on iOS systems, unless it was intentionally disabled by the user. With a marker, the user will be able to know exactly where on the map the photo was taken.
    After an image is taken, a popup will appear to confirm that the image was successfully saved in the camera roll. Additionally, an UI View will pop up on the top of the screen for 7 seconds for the user to preview the image previously taken.
    When "start" is pressed again, both the previous route, polylines, and markers will be reset, allowing the user to record another path without having to exit and re-enter the app.
